This is an extension of the “Pyg Latin” project from the Codecademy.com introductory Python course. Once I reached that project, I decided to code it entirely on my own and expand it past the basic requirements as far as possible with almost no prior knowledge of the language.

The eventual goal is for the user to be able to enter any string and for it to be converted, if possible, into correct Pig Latin.
